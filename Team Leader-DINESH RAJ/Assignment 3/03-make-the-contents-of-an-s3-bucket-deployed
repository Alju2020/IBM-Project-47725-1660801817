Make the contents of an S3 bucket deployed with CDK public

By default, an s3 bucket is secure and publicly inaccessible. To fix that, we'll have to add a single property to our LogoBucket.

const logoBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "LogoBucket", {
    publicReadAccess: true
});
Once deployed, our s3 links will be available to everyone.
